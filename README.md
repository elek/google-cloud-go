This repository contains a fork of the `spanner` subdirectory of https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/

This repository is created only as a workaround for this problem: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/9380

Original README can be found [here](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/main/spanner/README.md)

The original license (APACHE) can be found here: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/main/LICENSE

We hope that [issue](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/9380) will be fixed soon, and we don't need to use this fork anymore.

We strongly recommend to NOT use this library for any purposes. You have been warned.
